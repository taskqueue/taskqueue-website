# Clients

## REST / HTTP

TaskQueue was built on a REST API, so any standard HTTP client can send requests to it
and parse the responses.

## Clients by Language

The recommended client(s) for a language are marked with a :star:.

- Node / JS
  - [taskqueue-js](https://github.com/taskqueue/taskqueue-js) :star:
- .Net
  - [taskqueue-net](https://github.com/taskqueue/taskqueue-net) :star:
- Go
  - [taskqueue-go](https://github.com/taskqueue/taskqueue-go) :star:

We are working to add new languages all the time, but if there is a language that doesnt
exist and you would like to contribute, please fork this project and send a pull request
with your library.
