# Getting Started

TaskQueue allows you to integrate applications and components without having
to deal with the complexities of queueing systems.

The documentation is still under development, but we're working hard to improve
it! Please contact us if you run into trouble.


## Suggestions

If you notice the docs are out of date or unclear, please don't be shy forking the
[site on GitHub](https://github.com/taskqueue/taskqueue-website) and sending a pull
request. We're working to keep these docs up to date, however sometimes we get
behind â€“ and we'd love your help.
