# TaskQueue Website

The [TaskQueue](https://taskqueue.io) website, documentation and blog is
contained within this repo.

## Getting Started

The website is built on [flipside](https://github.com/reuben-interactive/flipside),
a Node CLI for static web development, to install run the following command:

```bash
$ npm install -g flipside
```

Next, open a terminal up in the root of the cloned repository, then run the `server`
server command for flipside in order to view the site and live reload as you edit
content.

```bash
$ flip server
```

behind â€“ and we'd love your help.
